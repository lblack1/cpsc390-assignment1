AI Prog assignment 1 notes

What classes:
	State - evaluation operator, successor function, agent - subclasses for different cost evaluation
	State node - state, next (for )
	Fringe - Queue of some sort, always best-first insertion
	Simulation - Closed list, Fringes, Some way to track current path (single linked list w/ head at the end?)

Procedure (simulation class)
	Read in grid - use to find inital state and goal state
	Assign initial state to current state
	While current state != goal state
		If current state == null:
			break
		Else:
			Insert current state to closed list (doesn't need to be full state node, can just be agent coords)
			Insert current state to path
			Get current state successors
			Insert sucessors not in closed list to fringe
			Pop(Fringe) -> current state
	return path (or fail)
